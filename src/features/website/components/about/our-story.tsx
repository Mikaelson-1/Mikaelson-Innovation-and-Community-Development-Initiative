        The Mikaelson Initiative was born from a deeply personal struggle. Our
        founder, Oluwasegun Olukayode, discovered a critical problem that was
        holding him back as both a student and an individual - procrastination,
        losing focus, and lacking a structured, purposeful life. These
        challenges were not just academic setbacks; they were barriers that
        prevented him from reaching his full potential and living the impactful
        life he envisioned.

        transition={{ duration: 0.6, delay: 0.4 }}

        Recognizing that he wasn&apos;t alone in this struggle, Oluwasegun realized
        that countless other African students were facing the same challenges -
        brilliant minds being held back by lack of structure, focus, and
        intentional personal development. This realization sparked a mission to
        create something bigger than himself.

        What began as one person&apos;s journey to overcome procrastination and build
        a focused, structured life has evolved into a movement reaching
        thousands of students across multiple universities. Today, the Mikaelson
        Initiative represents hope, possibility, and action - transforming not
        just individuals, but building a better Africa, one student at a time.
